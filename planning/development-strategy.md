# Development Strategy

We have decided to develop a page for users to do shopping. In the page a user
will be able to chose items from a catalogue and add them to his/her shopping
basket.

## 0. Setup

- Building user interface in a HTML file (Cristobal)
- Defining functions we need and their roles (Maria)

## 1. Data & Log

- Defining constants
- Put all constants in a separate file

## 2. Init

Call all `event listeners`

## 3. User Story_1

> As a user I want to create a list by choosing items from a catalogue

`HTML`

- [ ] We have a catalogue of items with pics, price displayed at the page
- [ ] We have an add button for each item

## 3. User Story_2

> As a user I want to see all the items in my basket

`HTML`

## 3. User Story_4

## 3. User Story_5

> As a user I want to see the total amount to be paid

  There will be different types of tasks for each user story:
    `type: components`
    `type: css`
    `type: logic`
    `type: handlers`
    ...
